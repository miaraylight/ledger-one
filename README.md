## üíª Interesting Code Segment: Animated, Rainbow Console Logo

Implemented an animated, colored startup logo. This code snippet handles iterating through the characters of the logo string, applying a cyclical rainbow color, and adding a slight delay to create a retro typing animation effect.

### üîç Code Snippet

```java
        final String RESET = "\u001B[0m";
        int colorIndex = 0;
        try {
            for (char ch : logo.toCharArray()) {
                System.out.print(COLORS[colorIndex % COLORS.length] + ch);
                Thread.sleep(1);
                colorIndex++;
            }
            System.out.println(RESET);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
```
